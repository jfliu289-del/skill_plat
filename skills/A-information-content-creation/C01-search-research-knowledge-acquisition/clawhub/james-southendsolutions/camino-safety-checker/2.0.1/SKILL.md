# Late Night Safety

Find 24-hour businesses, well-lit public areas, transit stations, police stations, and hospitals near any location. Provides safety-focused context awareness for late night situations.

## Setup

These skills shell out to `curl` and authenticate via the `CAMINO_API_KEY` environment variable. Sign up at [https://app.getcamino.ai/skills/activate](https://app.getcamino.ai/skills/activate) for 100 free calls/month and an API key.

**Add your key to Claude Code:**

Add to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "CAMINO_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Code.

**Alternative — pay-per-request via [x402](https://x402.org):** Camino's paid endpoints also accept HTTP 402 payments in USDC on Base ($0.001/request) from any x402-capable client, with no signup or API key. These skills don't use this path; it's for agents and clients that speak x402 natively.

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>

Mitigation: Use the skill only with notes that do not contain secrets, credentials, sensitive personal data, or material that should not appear in logs, screenshots, or shared files. <br>
Risk: Keyword extraction and key point detection are simple pattern-based analyses and may miss nuance. <br>
Mitigation: Review source notes before relying on summaries or keyword lists for decisions or external reports. <br>

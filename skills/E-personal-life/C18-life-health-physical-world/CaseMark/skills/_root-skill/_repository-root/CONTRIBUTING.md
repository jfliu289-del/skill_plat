## Creating a New Skill

1. **Start from the template**:
   ```bash
    cp -r template/ skills/legal/your-skill-name/
    # or
    cp -r template/ skills/med/your-skill-name/
     # or
     cp -r template/ skills/finance/your-skill-name/
     # or
     cp -r template/ skills/capital/your-skill-name/
    # or
    cp -r template/ skills/casedev/your-skill-name/
   ```

2. **Edit `SKILL.md`**:
   - Set `name` to match your directory name (lowercase, hyphens, max 64 chars)
   - Set `language` to the ISO 639-1 two-letter code for the skill's primary language (`en`, `es`, `fr`, …). Defaults to `en` if omitted.
   - Write a `description` in third person (max 1024 chars) that explains what it does AND when to use it
   - Write clear, concise instructions in the body

3. **Follow the spec**: See [spec/SKILL-SPEC.md](spec/SKILL-SPEC.md) for the full authoring standard.

4. **Open a PR**: The `skill-qa` workflow will automatically validate your skill and post a review.

## Quality Standards

Before submitting:

- [ ] `name` matches directory name, lowercase-hyphenated, under 64 chars
- [ ] `description` is third-person, under 1024 chars, includes trigger keywords

## PR Review Process

Every PR touching `skills/**` triggers automated QA:

1. **Format validation**: Frontmatter schema, line count, reference depth
2. **Semantic overlap check**: New skill descriptions are compared against existing skills. Flagged if cosine similarity > 0.85 with any existing skill.
3. **Content review**: An AI reviewer checks for conciseness, third-person descriptions, concrete examples, and adherence to the spec.
4. **Human review**: A CaseMark maintainer reviews the PR.

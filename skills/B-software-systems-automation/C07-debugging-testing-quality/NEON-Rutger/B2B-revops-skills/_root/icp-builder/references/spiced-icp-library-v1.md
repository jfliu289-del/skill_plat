# SPICED ICP Library v1

Working doc to keep **canonical SPICED language** for ICP clusters.

Use this as:

* Source of truth for **copy and messaging** (website, LinkedIn, emails, decks).

* Reference for **discovery, qualification, and RevOps design** (fields, stages, dashboards).

* Parking lot for **new SPICED snippets** you pull from transcripts and client work.

Clusters we care about right now:

* **PE** -- Growth / PE operators (e.g. Verdane) working across a portfolio.

* **L** -- Larger scale-ups with complex motions (Pleo-type; 30M+ ARR, multi-region, PLG + sales).

* **S** -- Smaller / immature SaaS scale-ups (iWell-type; 10-40M ARR but GTM maturity ~5-10M).

---

## A. Quick SPICED per cluster (short version)

Use this when you need a fast Situation/Pain paragraph for copy.

### 1. Generic SPICED (baseline)

**S -- Situation**
You're a B2B SaaS / tech company with multiple GTM teams and tools. Growth is no longer "for free" and you've outgrown the operating model and dashboards that got you here.

**P -- Pain**
Forecast calls feel like theatre, handoffs leak everywhere, CRM is a mess, and RevOps (if it exists) is a report factory drowning in random requests and meetings that don't change behaviour.

**I -- Impact**
Growth becomes lumpy, CAC payback stretches, NRR bands wobble, and leadership wastes hours reconciling whose dashboard is right instead of pulling clear levers.

**C -- Critical Event**
You're heading into the next planning / board cycle after one or two shaky quarters, with tighter budgets and sharper questions about forecast quality, CAC payback, and GTM risk.

**D -- Decision**
You decide to treat revenue as a **system** problem, not a pipeline problem: one revenue system that links strategy to metrics to weekly decisions, with clear owners and forecast bands instead of opinions.

---

### 2. PE / Value-Creation SPICED (Verdane-type)

**S -- Situation**
You oversee a portfolio of B2B SaaS / tech companies with wildly different GTM maturity and data quality. Each portco reports differently, few truly run on bowtie/SPICED, and GTM is mostly sales-led and opportunistic.

**P -- Pain**
You can't get a clean, comparable view across portcos. Data is terrible or inconsistent, reporting is biased, and strategy is often driven by HIPPOs and anecdotes instead of a shared revenue architecture.

**I -- Impact**
You can't judge GTM risk or capital efficiency with confidence. Rule of 40 (revenue growth rate plus free cash flow margin; best-in-class target 50%) and forecast durability are guesswork, value-creation becomes reactive firefighting, and your credibility with IC/LPs erodes when stories don't match outcomes (Aventis Advisors; Abacum, 2026).

**C -- Critical Event**
Several portcos have missed or sandbagged at the same time. You're rolling out Winning by Design / bowtie thinking and realise that without an execution layer (Rooms, cadence, definitions), it will become another deck.

**D -- Decision**
You standardise on a portfolio revenue system pattern: minimum viable data spine and definitions, one Revenue Room and cadence per portco, tested on a few anchor companies, with RevOps and leadership owning the system and you measuring success in cleaner bands and fewer GTM surprises.

---

### 3. Large Scale-Up SPICED (Pleo-type)

**S -- Situation**
You're a 30-200M+ ARR scale-up with several motions (PLG, sales-led, partner-led, multi-region) and a people-first culture that now sits under much tougher growth and efficiency targets (e.g. 30% actual, 50% target).

**P -- Pain**
ICP and segments aren't rock-solid across teams. Journey design is inconsistent, buying groups are invisible, contract-to-cash is slow, and different GTM silos run on different metrics and stories. Meetings proliferate but very few end in clear decisions and owners.

**I -- Impact**
You leak revenue at multiple points -- from lead to opportunity, from "won" to "live", from "live" to expansion. Cycle times stay long, cost-to-serve is high, and every extra euro of ARR feels more expensive than the last. Forecast misses start to pile up and the board's trust in the GTM story erodes.

**C -- Critical Event**
Leadership has raised the growth bar after a miss. Org and GTM structure have changed, roles and decision rights are in flux, and capital is more expensive -- this is the moment to harden a performance system without blowing up culture.

**D -- Decision**
You deliberately redesign the end-to-end journey, unify motions under one architecture (SPICED + bowtie), make HubSpot/SF the single commercial system of record, and pilot the system on one motion/region to prove faster delta-t and healthier NRR before scaling.

---

### 4. Immature Scale-Up SPICED (iWell-type)

**S -- Situation**
You're in the 10-40M ARR band with strong product and market tailwinds, but GTM is still run like a 5-10M company: pipeline in spreadsheets and inboxes, weak or non-existent CRM usage, no ABM, no sales qualification method, and new markets (e.g. DACH) are mostly hero-led.

**P -- Pain**
CRM is barely used. Deals live in email and offline notes. There's no formal qualification (no SPICED/MEDDIC), little or no marketing-sales SLA, and no structured ABM motion. You risk "floodgates": any uptick in demand overwhelms a small sales team that has no SLAs, no routing, no buying-group views, and limited capacity.

**I -- Impact**
You can't safely lean into new markets. Either you under-invest and miss the window while competitors educate the market, or you over-invest, flood sales with unqualified interest, and conclude "ABM doesn't work". The default lever becomes "hire more people" instead of "fix the system", which destroys capital efficiency.

**C -- Critical Event**
You're betting on a new market/segment at the same time as competitors are visibly struggling and regulations are shifting. Leadership wants to move "yesterday", but there's no shared view on ICP, buying groups, or what "good pipeline" looks like.

**D -- Decision**
You stop trying to "do more" and instead pick one ICP/segment as a lab: nail ICP and qualification (SPICED in CRM), stand up a simple ABM + research play (reports, roundtables, competitor-retrofit wedge), enforce basic SLAs and buying-group visibility, and use that lab to build a repeatable GTM machine for the next segment or country.

## B. Expanded SPICED Library by Letter

Use this section when you're designing discovery, copy, or system changes. Pick the cluster, then pull lines that match what you're seeing/hearing.

### B1. S -- Situation (expanded)

**Generic S -- Situation**

* Multiple GTM teams (marketing, SDR, AE, CS, partnerships) all touching the same customer journey.

* Tooling is more advanced than the way people actually work: HubSpot/SF, enablement tools, note-takers, AI -- but behaviour is still driven by legacy habits and hero reps.

* Growth used to come "for free" from product and market; now it requires deliberate design.

**PE -- Situation**

* Portfolio of 10-50+ B2B SaaS / tech companies across Europe/US.

* GTM maturity spectrum from "leads in spreadsheets" to "semi-mature bowtie", but no shared operating model.

* Different CRMs, different definitions, different rhythms; value-creation team must work through founders and their leadership teams.

**Large Scale-Up -- Situation**

* 30-200M+ ARR, multiple products/modules (e.g. cards, reimbursements, AP, subscriptions).

* Hybrid PLG + sales-led motions, often centralised SDR/AE hub plus local field roles.

* Multiple regions at different maturity; some markets are saturated and slow, others are high growth but under-resourced.

* Culture is people-first; now you need performance discipline without turning into a cold enterprise machine.

**Immature Scale-Up -- Situation**

* 10-40M ARR with a strong product wedge (climate tech, vertical SaaS, infra tooling, etc.).

* Founders and early salespeople closed the first wave of deals through networks and hustle.

* GTM stack exists (HubSpot, maybe some enrichment/intent tooling) but is under-used; internal processes still look like a 5-10M company.

Add more concrete S-lines per account here as you see them in transcripts.
Example: "Series B, 150 employees, selling to mid-market finance teams in 5 EU countries."

---

### B2. P -- Pain (expanded)

**Generic P -- Pain**

* Forecast calls feel like theatre; numbers change week to week with no clear explanation.

* Handoffs between teams leak: MQL→SQL, SQO→Closed, Closed→Onboarded, Onboarded→Active, Active→Expanding.

* CRM is noisy or half-empty; leadership doesn't fully trust it, reps don't see the value.

* RevOps is treated as a report factory and fire brigade rather than the owner of the revenue system.

**PE -- Pain**

* "Terrible data":

  * Leads and opportunities tracked in spreadsheets or manually-updated CRMs.

  * Reps self-report lead source and are incentivised to claim everything.

* No standard funnel or bowtie definitions; each portco defines SQL, pipeline, and NRR differently.

* Over-focus on new business and SQL volume, under-focus on usage, retention, cost-to-serve.

* GTM decisions in boardrooms are driven by strongest opinions, not comparable metrics.

* Value-creation work is reactive: when a portco misses, a one-off project is spun up; little leverage across the portfolio.

**Large Scale-Up -- Pain**

* ICP and segments vary by team/region; marketing talks about one ideal customer, sales about another, CS about a third.

* No shared journey design end-to-end; contract-to-cash and expansion flows are slow and poorly instrumented.

* No visible buying groups: big deals are run as if they were SMB deals with one contact.

* Meetings:

  * Many pipeline and forecast calls; few with clear decisions, owners, and follow-up.

  * Strategic priorities shift quarter to quarter; front-line teams get whiplash.

* NRR and usage-based revenue are inconsistent; leaders can't clearly articulate what drives expansion vs contraction.

**Immature Scale-Up -- Pain**

* CRM is a graveyard or an after-thought; key deals and contacts live in inboxes and personal spreadsheets.

* No shared qualification method; everyone uses their own version of "gut feel" to prioritize deals.

* No ABM motion:

  * No codified ICP beyond rough heuristics ("they're big and have money").

  * No structured way to identify in-market accounts or competitors' unhappy customers.

* Capacity bottlenecks:

  * A small sales team already feels stretched on existing inbound and network deals.

  * Any increase in top-of-funnel volume risks overwhelming them and lowering conversion.

Add client-specific pains under each cluster as you hear them. Use bullets starting with the exact phrase they used ("forecast theatre", "spreadsheet hell", "data is a dumpster fire").

---

### B3. I -- Impact (expanded)

**Generic I -- Impact**

* Growth becomes lumpy and hard to defend.

* CAC payback stretches and starts to challenge board thresholds.

* NRR bands wobble; strong quarters hide weak quarters and vice versa.

* Leadership time is sucked into reconciliation and re-interpretation instead of decision-making.

**PE -- Impact**

* Hard to answer basic IC/LP questions:

  * Which portcos have real GTM engines vs founder heroics?

  * Where is forecast risk concentrated?

  * Which GTM initiatives actually improved Rule of 40 or just burned runway?

* Harder to deploy capital confidently; GTM feels like a black box risk.

* Every board pack becomes a bespoke analysis project; founders lose operating time and you lose portfolio leverage.

**Large Scale-Up -- Impact**

* Revenue leaks across the bowtie; left side and right side don't reinforce each other.

* Hitting higher growth targets means either unsustainable heroics or more headcount/tools -- both erode operating leverage.

* Forecast misses accumulate; board confidence drops, internal narratives turn defensive.

* Product and market opportunity are strong, but the GTM system can't fully capitalise on them.

**Immature Scale-Up -- Impact**

* New market bets are risky and fragile; a few bad deals or lost projects feel existential.

* Good opportunities are lost because buying groups weren't mapped or nurtured; bad opportunities consume scarce cycles.

* Leadership keeps defaulting to "hire more" instead of fixing flow, which hits cash and dilutes focus.

* By the time they call RevOps, they are deep into complexity, not early.

Add concrete impact statements from transcripts: e.g. "we closed 5 big deals but can't explain why", "we're growing 30% aiming for 50%, but no one can show me the levers".

---

### B4. C -- Critical Event (expanded)

**Generic C -- Critical Event**

* Approaching a new planning cycle or fundraising with shaky GTM numbers and growing scrutiny on efficiency.

**PE -- Critical Event**

* Several portcos miss or sandbag in the same period.

* Formal WbD / bowtie training is being rolled out; there is appetite for a consistent framework.

* New partners/LPs demand clearer GTM risk bands and efficiency narratives.

**Large Scale-Up -- Critical Event**

* Growth targets are raised after a miss; "do what we did last year" will obviously not be enough.

* GTM reorg or leadership change (new CRO/CMO/VP Sales) creates a window to redefine operating model.

* External environment tightens (macro, capital costs); hit rate and efficiency suddenly matter more than raw volume.

**Immature Scale-Up -- Critical Event**

* New market/segment decision (e.g. expansion to DACH, move upmarket).

* Competitors stumble (bankruptcy, product issues), creating a short window to win their customers.

* Investor or board pressure to professionalise GTM and clean up data before the next raise.

Capture specific triggers here (e.g. "October miss put performance under the spotlight", "board asked us for forecast bands instead of a single number").

---

### B5. D -- Decision (expanded)

**Generic D -- Decision**

* Treat revenue as a system, not a pipeline: install one revenue system (Room + One-Page Plan + cadence) with clear owners, definitions, and bands.

**PE -- Decision**

* Standardise on a portfolio GTM pattern:

  * Minimum viable data model and definitions (SPICED + bowtie).

  * One Revenue Room and cadence per portco.

  * One way to talk about CAC/payback, NRR, and forecast bands.

* Start with 2-3 anchor companies, then roll pattern out.

**Large Scale-Up -- Decision**

* Intentionally design the end-to-end journey and unify GTM motions under one architecture.

* Establish a single Room where GTM and product leadership make decisions from the same view of risk and flow.

* Use a One-Page Plan and cadence to turn strategy and experiments into weekly decisions.

**Immature Scale-Up -- Decision**

* Pick one ICP/segment/region as a proving ground; treat it like a lab.

* Implement SPICED qualification in CRM; define ICP and disqualification clearly.

* Build a small but sharp ABM + research motion and enforce SLAs and buying-group visibility.

* Use the learnings and assets to scale to the next segment/region.

Keep adding D-lines as you see different flavours of "how they chose to move" in calls.

## B+. SPICED Qualification Tiers and ICP Fit Matrix

Use these tiers to score incoming deals and route them correctly in CRM.

### Qualification Tiers

| Tier | Label | Definition | CRM action |
|------|-------|-----------|------------|
| T1 | **Perfect fit** | Matches ICP on firmographic, technographic, AND SPICED criteria. Strong pain, clear trigger, reachable decision maker. | Fast-track. Assign to best-fit AE. Short qualification cycle. |
| T2 | **Good fit** | Matches ICP on most criteria. Some SPICED elements strong, others unclear. May need more discovery. | Standard process. Full discovery required. Monitor for upgrade to T1 or downgrade. |
| T3 | **Opportunistic** | Partially matches ICP. Pain exists but may not be acute. Deal may close but won't be a reference customer. | Lower priority. Qualify tightly. Accept if it doesn't distract from T1/T2 pipeline. |

### ICP Fit Matrix

Score each deal on two axes:

| | **High Urgency Fit** (strong trigger, budget, timeline) | **Medium Urgency** (aware of pain, no trigger yet) | **Low Urgency** (exploring, no pain acknowledged) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **High Selection Fit** (matches ICP criteria) | T1 -- Fast-track | T2 -- Nurture to trigger | T3 -- Warm, park for now |
| **Medium Selection Fit** (partial ICP match) | T2 -- Qualify tightly | T3 -- Nurture if capacity allows | Disqualify |
| **Low Selection Fit** (outside ICP) | T3 -- Only if easy win | Disqualify | Disqualify |

Encode these tiers as a CRM deal property (`icp_tier`: T1/T2/T3/DQ) and use it to filter pipeline views.

See the ICP building reference for the full ICP building methodology that produces these tiers.

## C. How to Extend This Library

Use this as a **living document**. When you get transcripts or new insight:

1. **Paste raw quotes** at the bottom under a heading like `New SPICED snippets -- [Client/Prospect Name]`.

2. Translate the best quotes into 1-2 line SPICED bullets under the correct cluster and letter.

3. Only promote phrasing to the "Quick SPICED" section at the top once it's been used a few times and feels canonical.

Suggested headings for new snippets:

* `New S-lines -- [Company]`

* `New P-lines -- [Company]`

* `New I-lines -- [Company]`

* etc.

This keeps the top of the document clean and stable, while the bottom behaves like a scratchpad for new language you discover in the wild.

# Marketing-to-Sales Handover Trigger Doctrine

## Core Principle: Handover Discipline Enables Accountability

A handover is the moment marketing passes an account to sales with three pieces of information: (1) "This account is engaged," (2) "Here are the people we have identified," (3) "Here is what we recommend as the first step." Sales then decides whether to pursue. The quality of the handover packet and the clarity of handover criteria determine whether marketing gets credit for the pipeline it influences or disappears into noise.

Handover discipline also protects sales. Poor handovers (low engagement, incomplete buying group, stale signals) waste AE time on accounts that are not ready. Good handovers (hot engagement, identified economic buyer and champion, recent critical event) accelerate pipeline.

## Handover Qualification Criteria

An account is ready for handover when THREE conditions align:

```
CONDITION 1: ENGAGEMENT SCORE >=100
└─ Account shows active buying signals
   Multiple sources or critical event detected
   Exception: Lower threshold (>=80) if critical event + Economic Buyer present

CONDITION 2: BUYING GROUP COVERAGE >=50%
└─ At least half of required roles identified
   OR Economic Buyer explicitly engaged (email reply, meeting accepted, proposal request)
   Exception: Can handover with <50% IF critical event (demo, RFP) + Economic Buyer confirmed

CONDITION 3: ACCOUNT HAS NOT BEEN HANDED BEFORE
└─ First handoff only. If sales rejected previously, requirement is stricter.
   (See "Persistent Rejection" section below.)
```

**All three must be true to trigger handover.** Handover occurs when all three gates are OPEN. If any gate is closed, account remains in marketing nurture.

## Critical Events (Handover Accelerators)

A critical event can accelerate handover even if engagement score is borderline (70-100), provided buying group requirements are partially met.

### Critical Event Definitions

```
CRITICAL EVENT                      BUYING GROUP GATE          TIME TO HANDOVER
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. DEMO REQUEST
   (Contact submits demo form)      Economic Buyer should be    24 hours
                                    identifiable OR present
                                    in the request

2. MEETING SCHEDULED
   (Calendar invite from            N/A                         Immediate
    prospect for discovery call)    (Trigger assumes they sent
                                     it for a reason)

3. PROPOSAL REQUEST
   (Prospect explicitly asks        N/A (explicit ask)          Immediate
    for pricing or proposal)

4. RFP ISSUED
   (Formal request for proposal)    N/A (formal process)        Immediate

5. PRODUCT TRIAL ACTIVATION
   (User signs up for free trial    At least 1 identified       Follow within 7 days
    and completes first action:     contact should be the       (not immediate;
    creates account, invites users, champion or power user      allow trial to show
    runs first report)              for this signal)            value)

6. THIRD-PARTY INTENT SPIKE
   (News mention, analyst review,   2+ roles showing active     48 hours
    job posting for related role,   engagement OR recent
    competitive mention on social)  signal >5 days old

7. BUYING SIGNAL CLUSTERING
   (Demo request + meeting request  No buying group gate;       24-48 hours
    within 2 weeks from different   account clearly moving
    contacts)
```

**Critical events are binary.** They either happened or did not. Track them in CRM as explicit milestone dates. When a critical event occurs, alert sales within the time window above.

## Handover Packet Specification

When an account meets handover criteria, marketing prepares a formal handover packet. This packet is sales' brief on the account.

### Section 1: Executive Summary (1 paragraph)

```
[Company Name] is actively researching [solution category] with [engagement summary].
Our recommended next step is [specific action]. This account is ready for AE conversation.
```

**Example:**
"Acme Corp is actively evaluating infrastructure automation solutions. We have identified
three key stakeholders: CFO (budget owner), CTO (technical decision-maker), and VP Ops
(end-user champion). Recent signals include a demo request and pricing page review. CTO
Mark Johnson has engaged twice. Recommend AE reach out to Jane Smith (CFO) with a
business case focused on operational efficiency. We have a warm intro via Mark."

### Section 8: CRM Readiness Checklist

```
☑ Account record created in Salesforce
☑ Contact records created (Mark Johnson, Jane Smith, Tom Brown)
☑ Contact roles assigned (CTO, CFO, VP Operations)
☑ Account tagged with: "ABM", "Tier 1", "Active Buying"
☑ Opportunity structure: (recommend creating now if in-market)
  ☐ Opportunity record created? _____ (AE to create after first call)
☑ Activity history visible (email/call/meeting dates in CRM)
☑ Previous interactions logged (any prior sales touches? No n/a clean account)
☑ EU compliance check (if account in EU): No Article 21 right-to-object recorded
  (Verify: Contact has not exercised unconditional right to object to direct
   marketing. If yes on record, do NOT hand to sales; remove from outreach list.)
```

**DPIA Note (for large-scale engagement profiling and buying group mapping):** Under EU AI Act and GDPR Article 35, large-scale automated profiling of buying group members (especially when using automated role detection or stakeholder mapping) may trigger Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) requirements. The DPIA is prudent but not automatically mandatory under current guidance (EDPB; as of June 2026). If your handover packet or engagement system performs algorithmic classification of contacts by role or buying intent, document the processing and maintain evidence of fairness testing.

### Section 9: Handover Metadata

## Handover SLA and Sales Acceptance Workflow

### Handover SLA (Service Level Agreement)

**Marketing SLA to Sales:**
- Handover packet delivered by end of business day
- All data current as of that morning

**Sales SLA to Marketing:**
- Sales reviews and responds within 48 hours
- Response includes: ACCEPT or REJECT
- If REJECT, sales provides reason code (see rejection codes below)

### Sales Acceptance Workflow

When sales receives a handover:

```
STEP 1: SALES REVIEWS HANDOVER PACKET (within 24 hours)
        ↓
STEP 2: DECIDE: ACCEPT or REJECT?
        ↓
        ACCEPT PATH                     REJECT PATH
        ↓                               ↓
STEP 3: Create opportunity             Provide rejection reason code
        Assign AE                       (see table below)
        Log in CRM
        ↓
STEP 4: AE reaches out within 3 days   Marketing analyses feedback
        (typically within 48h)          Re-engages account or updates
        ↓                               criteria
STEP 5: Log first AE activity
        (call / meeting / email)
        Mark as "in sales process"
```

### Sales Rejection Reason Codes

When sales rejects a handover, they select a reason code. This feedback loops back to marketing and informs process adjustment.

```
CODE          REASON                         MARKETING ACTION
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
ICP_UNFIT     Company does not match ICP.    Remove from TAM list immediately.
              Size, industry, geography,     Audit how they got added.
              or use case mismatch.

BG_GAP        Critical buying group role     Prospect for missing role.
              missing (esp. economic buyer   Re-engage if found.
              if they are not responding).

LOW_INTENT    No recent engagement. Signals  Re-nurture or recycle to next
              are stale (>30 days old).      quarter. Check for signal
              Timing is off.                 capture issues.

BAD_TIMING    Account is real but not        Park in nurture. Requeue for
              buying now. Evaluating for     Q4 or next year.
              next year or other timeline.

DUPLICATE     Account already has open       Remove from ABM list. Merge
              opportunity or sales activity. buying group into existing
                                             opportunity in sales system.

WRONG_PERSON  Primary contact identified is  Find new champion. Prospect for
              not a real decision-maker.     different contact. Re-engage.
              No authority to move forward.

PROSPECT_      Account already owned by       Remove from marketing list.
CONFLICT       sales. AE has active eval.    Note: no double-work.
                                             Inform sales of new buying
                                             group members identified.
```

**Track rejection patterns quarterly:**
- If >50% rejected for "Low Intent": your engagement score threshold is too low
- If >50% rejected for "BG Gap": your prospecting/identification process is weak
- If >50% rejected for "ICP Unfit": your TAM definition needs revision
- Healthy rejection rate: 40-60% (some accounts need more nurture, some are poor fits)

## Persistent Rejection and Re-Qualification

If an account has been handed to sales and rejected twice, that account requires explicit re-qualification before a third handover.

### Persistent Rejection Workflow

```
ATTEMPT 1: Hand to sales
           ↓
           ACCEPT → Into sales pipeline
           REJECT → Feedback collected, re-engage per reason code
           ↓
ATTEMPT 2: (After 60 days of continued engagement)
           Re-assess engagement score and buying group
           Hand to sales again
           ↓
           ACCEPT → Into sales pipeline
           REJECT → STOP. Do not hand again.
           ↓
ATTEMPT 3: (ONLY with explicit conditions)
           Can hand again if:
           - Engagement score has risen >50 points since last rejection
           - A new champion has been identified
           - A critical event has occurred
           - Buying group coverage has improved >25%
           - Sales confirms they will actively pursue (not auto-reject)
           ↓
           Hand with explicit caveat: "We heard feedback. Here's what changed."
```

### Re-Qualification Criteria (Before Attempt 3)

```
METRIC                              BEFORE REJECTION    AFTER RE-ENGAGEMENT    CHANGE
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Engagement Score                    95                  150                    +58%
Buying Group Coverage               55%                 75%                    +20%
Champion Status                     None identified     Mark Johnson (CTO)     NEW
Critical Events                     1 (demo req)        3 (demo + meeting +    +2
                                                        proposal req)
Last Signal Date                    45 days old         2 days old             Recent
```

If re-qualified account meets >3 of the above changes, handover is warranted.

## Special Cases and Exceptions

### Exception 1: Multiple Contacts from Same Account

If two different people from the same account meet handover criteria independently, treat as ONE account handover, not two.

**Action:**
1. Merge buying group info into one handover packet
2. Highlight that multiple people are engaged (positive signal)
3. Hand as single account to one AE
4. Recommend AE loop both contacts into first conversation

### Exception 2: Account Already in Sales Pipeline

If sales already has an open opportunity at the account, do NOT hand separately.

**Action:**
1. Identify the existing opportunity owner (AE name)
2. Send handover packet directly to that AE (not to sales manager)
3. Packet includes: "New buying group members identified: [names]. Recommend you loop them in."
4. Log in CRM as "buying group expansion" or "multi-threading support"
5. Do NOT create a competing opportunity

### Exception 3: Account with Declined Champion

If the identified champion explicitly declines to help or leaves the company, do NOT hand immediately.

**Action:**
1. Re-assess account without that champion
2. If engagement score drops >50 points, recycle to nurture
3. If score remains healthy via other contacts, identify new champion before handing
4. Add to handover packet: "Prior champion [name] is no longer at company. New champion prospect: [name]. May need AE to validate."

### Exception 4: Super-Hot Account (Score >200)

If an account reaches 200+ engagement points with multiple critical events clustered, handover immediately regardless of normal gates.

**Action:**
1. Escalate to Sales Director (do not wait for manager review)
2. Provide raw handover packet (even if buying group incomplete)
3. Recommend AE calls immediately (same day)
4. Packet note: "This account is in-market NOW. Buying group not yet complete; recommend AE drives buying committee discovery."

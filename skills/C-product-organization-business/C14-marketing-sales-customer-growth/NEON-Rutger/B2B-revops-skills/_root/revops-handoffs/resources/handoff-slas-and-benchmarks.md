# Handoff SLAs, Benchmarks & Measurement

Complete SLA targets, research-backed benchmarks, metrics per handoff point, leading indicators of failure, and dashboard architecture for the full bow-tie model.

## 1. Speed-to-Lead Research

### Landmark Studies

**MIT/InsideSales.com (Dr. James Oldroyd, 2007; 15,000+ leads across 6 companies)**:
- 5-minute response: 21× more likely to qualify vs 30 minutes
- 100× more likely to make contact vs 30 minutes
- Optimal window: 1-5 minutes

**Velocify**: responding within 1 minute increases conversion by 391%.

**HBR (2,241 companies)**: average B2B response time is 42 hours. 23% of companies never responded at all.

**Workato (2024, 114 B2B companies tested)**: only 1 company sent personalised email within 5 minutes. Average personalised response: 11 hours 54 minutes. Companies using routing tools: 3 hours 32 minutes.

**Chili Piper (2025, 4M form submissions)**: instant booking converts 66.7% of qualified submissions to meetings vs ~30% industry average.

### Response SLA Framework by Lead Type

| Lead Source | Response SLA | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Demo requests / pricing page visits | < 5 minutes | Highest intent; actively comparing options |
| Paid advertising leads | < 3 minutes | Hottest, highest cost-per-lead |
| Partner referrals | < 30 minutes | Warm but relationship-dependent |
| Organic inbound (search) | < 10 minutes | Moderate intent |
| Content downloads / webinars | 3-4 days (nurture first) | Low-to-mid intent; premature outreach damages trust |
| Event / trade show leads | Same business day | Context fades quickly |

### Follow-Up Cadence

5-10 contact attempts yield 90% of lead value. Recommended pattern:
- Attempt 1: within SLA (call + email)
- Attempt 2: 4 hours later (different channel)
- Attempt 3: next business day
- Attempts 4-6: every 2 days
- Attempts 7-10: weekly

After 10 attempts with no response: return to marketing nurture with disposition noted.

## 2. Lead Scoring Benchmarks

### Conversion Rates

| Metric | Industry Average | Best-in-Class |
|---|---|---|
| MQL-to-SQL conversion | 15-21% | 39-40% (with behavioural scoring) |
| SQL-to-Opportunity | 50-60% | 70%+ |
| Lead scoring adoption | 44% of orgs |, |
| ML scoring vs manual |, | 75% higher conversion with ML |

### Scoring Model Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | Components |
|---|---|---|
| Firmographic fit | 40% | ICP match: industry, size, geography, title, tech stack |
| Behavioural intent | 40% | Pricing page (+30-40), demo request (+50, auto-route), content (+15-20), email engagement (+5-10), decay (-10/14d inactivity) |
| Third-party intent | 20% | 6sense/Bombora/Breeze signals, anonymous research behaviour |

Output quadrant: High Fit + High Intent = immediate sales. High Fit + Low Intent = nurture. Low Fit + High Intent = monitor. Low Fit + Low Intent = deprioritise.

### MQL vs Buying Group

Forrester data: lead-centric MQL process has 99% failure rate from inquiry to close. <5% of MQLs convert to opportunities. 93% of B2B buyers participate in buying groups of 2+ people, generating 27 engagements on average.

Pragmatic approach: maintain sharp MQL definitions but layer in account-level engagement signals and hand-raiser prioritisation. Full buying-group motions are operationally complex on HubSpot/Salesforce.

## 3. Marketing-Sales SLA Framework

### SLA Components

**Marketing commits to**:
- X qualified MQLs per month/quarter meeting agreed definitions
- Pipeline contribution: typically 4× coverage for current quarter
- Lead quality: defined firmographic and behavioural thresholds
- Data completeness: minimum enrichment before handoff

**Sales commits to**:
- Respond within defined time windows (by lead type)
- Minimum 5-10 follow-up attempts per lead
- CRM disposition within 48 hours of last attempt
- Feedback on lead quality (accept/reject with reason)

**Enforcement**:
- Auto-escalation at 1× SLA breach
- Auto-reassignment at 2× SLA breach
- Weekly SLA compliance dashboard
- Monthly SLA review meeting

**Impact**: companies with formal SLAs achieve 31% higher close rates and 24% faster revenue growth (SiriusDecisions).

## 4. Sales → Implementation SLAs

| Milestone | Target | Measurement |
|---|---|---|
| Internal AE → CSM/Impl briefing | 24-48h post-signature | Timestamp delta: closed_won_date to briefing_date |
| Customer introduction email | Within first week | Workflow completion date |
| Kickoff call scheduled | 48-72h post-signing | Calendar event creation date |
| First implementation meeting | 2 days (best) to 7 days (standard) | implementation_kickoff_date - closed_won_date |

### Handoff Information Completeness

Required fields at Closed Won (gate stage advancement):
- SPICED: situation, pain, impact, critical event, decision criteria
- Business goals with measurable success criteria
- Onboarding POC email
- Stakeholder list (champion, economic buyer, end users)
- Technical requirements (integrations, migration, compliance)
- Contract dates (start, end)
- Competing solutions considered
- Partner sourced (Y/N) + partner company if applicable

Target: >90% of required fields populated. Measure via calculated property.

### Handoff Quality Score

Receiving team (CSM/implementation lead) rates 1-5:
1. Information completeness, were all fields populated and accurate?
2. Promise alignment, do commitments match what was documented?
3. Customer expectations, were expectations set realistically?
4. Stakeholder access, can we reach the right people?
5. Technical readiness, are requirements clear and feasible?

Target: ≥4.0 average. Review weekly. Trend quarterly.

## 5. Implementation → CS SLAs

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Time to first value (TTFV) | Segment-dependent | Enterprise 30-90d, Mid-market 14-30d, SMB 1-7d |
| Go-live rate (on time) | >85% within contracted timeframe | Track by segment and implementation complexity |
| Onboarding completion | >95% | All training modules, configuration, data migration |
| Implementation velocity | Trending down QoQ | Duration from kickoff to go-live |
| Onboarding churn | <3% | Customers who churn before or during onboarding |

### Go-Live Readiness Criteria

Five conditions, all must be true:
1. **Tasks work**, critical processes complete end-to-end
2. **People trained**, key users completed training, admin certified
3. **Data migrated**, clean, validated, accessible
4. **Support plan**, escalation paths, contact points, SLAs defined
5. **Rollback plan**, contingency if go-live fails

### Implementation Health Indicators

Start measuring during implementation, not after:
- Onboarding milestone completion rate (% on schedule)
- Stakeholder engagement (right people showing up to calls?)
- Customer responsiveness (time to respond to requests)
- Admin login frequency (early adoption signal)
- Training session attendance (% of target users)

Health score below 30 correlates with ~7% churn risk. Above 50: <1% (HBR).

## 6. CS → Sales Expansion SLAs

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Expansion pipeline from CS | Growing QoQ | Track both volume and conversion |
| CS-to-sales handoff time | <48h from signal to AE engagement | Signal date to first AE activity |
| Expansion win rate (upsell) | >40% | Same DMU, shorter cycle |
| Expansion win rate (warm cross-sell) | >30% | Partial DMU overlap |
| Expansion win rate (new-DMU cross-sell) | >20% | Full discovery cycle |
| NRR | 110-130%+ | Best-in-class |
| GRR | 85-95% | Enterprise should be >95% |
| Expansion as % of new ARR | 50-60% (top performers) | Track trend QoQ |
| Expansion CAC vs new-logo CAC | 4-5× cheaper | $0.27 vs $1.16 per dollar ACV |
| Probability of selling to existing customer | 60-70% | vs 5-20% for new prospects |

### Expansion Economics

Every 1% increase in revenue retention increases company value by 12% after 5 years (SaaS Capital). Expansion revenue payback: ~1 quarter vs 12+ months for new logos (Pacific Crest Survey).

## 7. Leading Indicators of Handoff Failure

| Indicator | Threshold | Probable Cause | First Response |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rising unworked lead rate | >10% | SDR overload or routing failure | Audit routing rules, check capacity |
| Increasing MQL rejection rate | >30% | Marketing-sales ICP misalignment | Joint ICP review session |
| Growing time-to-kickoff | >14 days | Sales-to-CS bottleneck | Pre-close resource planning |
| Declining onboarding completion | <90% | Capacity or product complexity | Segment by complexity, adjust staffing |
| Dropping 30-day CSAT | <70% | Poor expectation-setting during sales | Audit promise alignment scores |
| Shrinking expansion pipeline from CS | Declining 2+ quarters | CS not identifying/surfacing signals | Train CS on signal recognition, instrument triggers |
| Rising first-year churn | >15% | Systemic handoff failure | Segment churn by handoff quality scores to isolate root cause |

## 9. Territory & Routing Design

### Four Models

| Model | Best For | Tradeoff |
|---|---|---|
| Geographic | Travel-heavy, local market knowledge needed | Less relevant in digital SaaS |
| Vertical/Industry | Domain expertise drives faster deals | Uneven opportunity sizes |
| Named accounts | Deep strategic relationships | Requires strong ABM infra |
| Hybrid (recommended) | Most B2B SaaS scale-ups | Segment × vertical × geography |

### EU-Specific Clusters

Start with language-based routing:
- **DACH**, German required, formal buying processes
- **Nordics**, high digital fluency, English-friendly
- **UK & Ireland**, closest to US patterns
- **Western Europe**, French critical for France
- **Southern Europe**, relationship-driven
- **CEE**, emerging, cost-sensitive

Route by language of form submission as first-pass filter.

### Routing by Lead Type

| Lead Type | Routing | SLA |
|---|---|---|
| Hand-raiser (demo, pricing) | Direct to territory AE | 5 minutes |
| MQL (score-qualified) | To SDR for qualification | 4 hours |
| Partner referral | Via partner manager to territory AE | 24 hours (priority flag) |
| Expansion signal | CSM to AE with context | 48 hours |
| PQL (usage-based) | Auto-route by account | Same business day |

**Account-based override**: when a lead from a known account enters, route to existing account owner regardless of rotation. Non-negotiable.

### Capacity-Based Routing

Factor current pipeline load. Rep at 120% capacity shouldn't receive new leads. Use weighted round-robin with capacity adjustment at scale.

### Territory Design by ARR Stage

- **€15M ARR** (5-15 AEs): simple geographic clusters, round-robin, generalist AEs
- **€50M ARR** (30-60 AEs): weighted round-robin with territory rules, hunter/farmer split, cluster-based EU coverage
- **€150M ARR** (100+ AEs): full matrix (segment × vertical × geography), capacity-based + AI-assisted routing, country-level local-language reps

Apply the ±10% rule: no territory should have more than 10% higher or lower total workload than team average.

# Salesforce Automation & Flow Reference

**Critical**: Process Builder and Workflow Rules ended support on 31 December 2025 (now passed). Salesforce ceased accepting new Process Builder creations in Spring 2025. Zero support exists for new issues in Process Builder as of July 2026. All automation must migrate to Salesforce Flow immediately; any remaining Process Builders are a technical debt liability and should be deactivated and replaced.

## Flow Types

| Flow Type | Trigger | Use For |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Record-Triggered (Before Save)** | Before database commit | Field updates on same record; validation; defaults |
| **Record-Triggered (After Save)** | After database commit | Creating/updating other records; notifications; external calls |
| **Scheduled Flow** | Cron schedule or one-time datetime | Batch jobs; nightly recalculations; SLA escalations |
| **Platform Event-Triggered** | Platform event published | Async processing; integration patterns; decoupled architecture |
| **Screen Flow** | User clicks button/link | Guided processes; multi-step forms; wizard data entry |
| **Autolaunched Flow** | Called from other flows, Apex, or REST API | Reusable logic modules; sub-flows; integration endpoints |

## Before-Save vs After-Save Decision

```
Need to update the SAME record that triggered the flow?
  → Before-Save (faster, no extra DML)

Need to create/update OTHER records?
  → After-Save

Need to call external services or send notifications?
  → After-Save with Async Path (non-blocking)

Performance-critical with high volume?
  → Before-Save wherever possible
```

## Flow Architecture Best Practices

### Consolidation Strategy

Maximum 3 record-triggered flows per object:
1. **Before-Save** (field defaults, validations, same-record updates)
2. **After-Save** (cross-object updates, notifications, integrations)
3. **Before-Delete** (validation, cleanup, archival)

Within each flow, use Decision elements to branch logic.

### Naming Convention

`[Object]_[Trigger]_[Purpose]_v[Version]`

Examples:
- `Lead_AfterSave_Assignment_v3`
- `Opportunity_BeforeSave_StageValidation_v1`
- `Account_Scheduled_EnrichmentRefresh_v2`

### Version Management

- Keep last working version inactive (not deleted) for rollback
- Date-stamp description: `v12 (2026-03-15): Added territory-based routing`
- Never delete a flow version that was active in production

### Feature Flags

Store configuration in Custom Metadata Types or Custom Settings to enable/disable flow logic without redeployment.

```
Decision Element: "Is Feature Enabled?"
  → Get Records: Custom_Setting__c WHERE Feature_Name = "New_Routing"
  → If Enabled__c = true → Execute new logic
  → If Enabled__c = false → Execute legacy logic
```

## Flow vs Apex Decision

```
Start with Flow (default for 80% of use cases)
  ↓
Batch processing >10K records? → Apex Batch
  ↓
Logic too complex (>50 flow elements)? → Apex Invocable Action (callable from Flow)
  ↓
Advanced error handling / retry? → Apex with try-catch-finally
  ↓
Real-time integration, sub-second response? → Apex callout
  ↓
Otherwise → Stay with Flow
```

**Hybrid pattern**: Complex logic in Apex as Invocable Actions, called from Flow. Flow handles orchestration, Apex handles heavy lifting.

## Common Anti-Patterns

### 1. Mixing Automation Entry Points
Running both Apex triggers AND flows on same object creates unpredictable execution order. Pick one.

### 2. DML in Loops
The single greatest cause of governor limit failures. Always bulkify: process collections, not individual records.

### 3. Recursive Flows
After-Save flow updates a record, triggering another After-Save flow. Solutions:
- Use `$Flow.CurrentRecord` checks
- Recursion guard via static variable (Apex) or Custom Setting flag
- Before-Save for same-record updates (avoids recursion entirely)

### 4. No Error Handling
Flows that fail silently. Always add Fault paths with admin notification.

### 5. Hardcoded IDs
Referencing record IDs, user IDs, or queue IDs directly. Use Custom Metadata Types or Custom Labels.

## Process Builder → Flow Migration Guide

### Migration Steps

1. **Audit**: Document every Process Builder, Workflow Rule, and Apex trigger per object
2. **Map execution order**: Understand current firing sequence
3. **Consolidate**: Multiple PBs on same object → one After-Save Flow with Decision branches
4. **Test in sandbox**: Flow execution order differs from PB; validate all rules
5. **Migrate in phases**: One object at a time, lowest-risk first
6. **Deactivate, don't delete**: Keep old PBs inactive until new Flows validated

### Migration Pitfalls

- **Execution order changes**: Flows run differently than PBs. Test all scenarios.
- **Recursive triggers**: PBs had built-in recursion prevention; Flows don't. Add guards.
- **Field update timing**: Before-Save Flows run earlier than PB "immediate actions."

## Common Flow Patterns for RevOps

### Lead Scoring Recalculation
```
Before-Save on Lead (any update)
  → Calculate Fit_Score__c (firmographic criteria)
  → Calculate Engagement_Score__c (activity-based)
  → Set Total_Score__c = Fit + Engagement
  → Set Score_Tier__c based on thresholds
```

### Opportunity Stage Gate
```
Before-Save on Opportunity (Stage changed)
  → Decision: Is new stage > old stage + 1?
    → Yes: Show error "Cannot skip stages"
  → Decision: Is Stage ≥ Proposal AND Amount = null?
    → Yes: Show error "Amount required at Proposal stage"
  → Decision: Is Stage = Closed Lost AND Loss_Reason = null?
    → Yes: Show error "Loss reason required"
```

### Stale Deal Alert
```
Scheduled Flow (daily at 08:00)
  → Query Opportunities WHERE IsClosed = false
    AND Last_Activity_Date < TODAY - threshold
    AND Stale_Alert_Sent__c = false
  → For each:
    → Set Stale_Flag__c = true
    → Send notification to Owner + Manager
    → Create Task: "Review stale opportunity"
```

### Enrichment Integration
```
After-Save on Lead (create only, Async Path)
  → Invocable Apex: Call enrichment API
  → Map response → Lead fields
  → Trigger scoring recalculation
```

### Post-Call Sentiment Analysis (Einstein Conversation Insights)
```
Scheduled Flow (daily at 08:00)
  → Query Opportunities WHERE Stage ≥ Qualification
    AND Sentiment_Score__c = null
  → For each Opportunity with recorded calls:
    → Read Einstein Conversation Insights generative summary
    → Extract: Sentiment_Score__c, Objections_Found__c, Next_Steps__c
    → Set Pipeline_Health__c = "At Risk" if objections >2
    → Create Task for rep: "Address objections per call notes"
```

This pattern integrates Einstein Conversation Insights (Spring 2026+) for coaching and deal health. Alerts focus on objection density and stakeholder disagreement flagged by the AI.

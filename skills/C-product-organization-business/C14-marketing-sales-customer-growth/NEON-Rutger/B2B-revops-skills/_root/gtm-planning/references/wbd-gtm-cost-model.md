## Section 1: Seven Cost Centres per GTM Motion

Every GTM motion runs seven cost centres. Cost intensity varies by motion type: the further right (higher touch), the heavier the human cost in Selection and post-sale stages.

| Cost Centre | No Touch | Low Touch | Medium Touch | High Touch | Dedicated |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Cost of Leaders** (Awareness) | Low; content and SEO, minimal human | Low-Medium; paid and content | Medium; field marketing, events | High; field sales, ABM, events | Very High; enterprise field, C-suite selling |
| **Cost of LeadDev** (Education) | Very Low; automated nurture | Low; SDR/BDR lite, sequences | Medium; SDR team, qualification | High; AE and SDR pairs, multi-thread | Very High; enterprise BDR, exec sponsors |
| **Cost of Selling** (Selection) | None / product-led | Low; inside sales, short cycle | Medium; mid-market AE, 30-60d cycle | High; enterprise AE, 60-180d cycle | Very High; dedicated AE and SA, 6-18 month cycle |
| **Order Processing** (Commit) | Very Low; automated contract and payment | Low; e-signature, minimal ops | Medium; RevOps deal desk | High; legal, procurement, deal desk | Very High; complex legal, multi-year negotiation |
| **Cost of Onboarding** | Very Low; self-serve, in-product | Low; CSM pooled, email-led | Medium; dedicated onboarding CSM | High; implementation team, project management | Very High; enterprise PS team, custom integration |
| **Cost of Retention** | Low; in-product health signals, automated | Low-Medium; pooled CSM, tech-touch | Medium; dedicated CSM, QBR cadence | High; strategic CSM, executive relationships | Very High; dedicated account team, CS and AE overlap |
| **Cost of Expansion** | Very Low; in-product upgrade, automated | Low; CSM-led, low touch | Medium; CS-to-Sales handoff | High; expansion AE and CSM joint play | Very High; dedicated expansion AE, enterprise account growth |

**Reading the table:** No Touch and Low Touch compress cost through automation and scale. High Touch and Dedicated compress cost through LTV; higher ACV justifies the spend. The danger zone is Medium Touch misapplied to Low ACV deals; the cost structure breaks unit economics.

## Section 2: Cost-to-Serve Benchmarks by ARR

Cost-to-serve = total GTM cost (all seven centres) ÷ ARR. Declines as the company scales through process maturity and automation.

| ARR Stage | Typical Cost-to-Serve Ratio | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| €1M | ~40% | Early-stage: founder-led, high experimentation cost |
| €5M | ~35% | Scaling: hiring into motion, cost not yet leveraged |
| €10M | ~30% | First leverage: playbooks forming, hiring more efficient |
| €25M | ~27% | Process maturity: predictable funnel, automation kicking in |
| €50M | ~25% | Operational efficiency: RevOps function in place |
| €100M | ~20% | Scale: strong automation, specialised roles, comp leverage |
| €200M+ | ~15% | Mature: significant automation, low marginal cost per new €ARR |

**Target range at scale:** 15-25%. Below 15% risks under-investment in retention and expansion. Above 30% at €25M+ signals a broken motion; investigate which cost centre is inflated relative to its contribution.

**Diagnostic use:** If a client's cost-to-serve is higher than benchmark for their ARR stage, the first question is always which cost centre is the outlier. Selling cost and onboarding cost are the most common culprits.

## Section 3: Durability Thresholds (GRR by Motion)

GRR (Gross Retention Rate) measures revenue retained from existing customers, net of downgrades and churn, before expansion. GRR is the floor of your NRR; you cannot have sustainable NRR without GRR health.

Target GRR varies by motion because the average customer relationship, switching cost, and product stickiness differ:

| GTM Motion | Target GRR | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| No Touch | >80% | Self-serve products have higher churn velocity; acceptable at lower ACV |
| Low Touch | >85% | Light CS coverage requires strong in-product stickiness to compensate |
| Medium Touch | >90% | Dedicated CSM relationship justifies higher retention expectation |
| High Touch | >95% | Strategic relationship + deep integration = high switching cost |
| Dedicated | >98% | Enterprise contract + custom integration + exec relationship = near-permanent |

**Warning sign:** GRR below threshold by >3 points in any motion = structural retention problem, not a one-quarter anomaly. Trigger a churn root cause review.

**GRR vs NRR framing for clients:** "GRR is the foundation; you can't build NRR on a leaking bucket. If GRR is below threshold, fix retention before investing in expansion programmes."

## Section 4: Throughput Improvement Framework

Three levers exist to improve throughput (output per unit of GTM cost) in any motion. The right lever depends on the cost centre and the ARR stage.

### The Three Levers

**Streamline**: Remove steps, handoffs, and friction from the process. Reduces cost without technology investment. Best for: High Touch and Dedicated motions where process complexity has accumulated over time.

**Automate**: Replace human tasks with AI or tooling. Reduces marginal cost per deal/customer. Best for: No Touch, Low Touch, and Medium Touch motions where volume is high enough to justify tooling investment. Also applies to RevOps tasks (data entry, reporting, QBR prep) in all motions.

**Enhance**: Improve the skill level of the team. Increases output quality and conversion rates without reducing cost. Best for: High Touch and Dedicated motions where conversion rate and deal size are the primary levers. Also applies when ACV is high enough that a 5% conversion improvement outweighs a 20% cost reduction.

### Lever Prioritisation by Motion and Stage

| Motion | €1-10M ARR Priority | €10-50M ARR Priority | €50M+ ARR Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| No Touch | Streamline (remove signup friction) | Automate (lifecycle, scoring, expansion triggers) | Automate + Streamline |
| Low Touch | Streamline (qualification, handoff) | Automate (SDR sequencing, CRM hygiene) | Automate + Enhance (CSM productivity) |
| Medium Touch | Enhance (AE skill, discovery quality) | Streamline + Automate (deal desk, onboarding) | All three in balance |
| High Touch | Enhance (enterprise selling, multi-threading) | Enhance + Streamline (complex deals) | Enhance + Automate (CS at scale) |
| Dedicated | Enhance (executive relationships) | Enhance + Streamline (account planning) | Enhance + Streamline |

**AI as Automate lever:** AI agents (call prep, pipeline risk, CRM hygiene, renewal alerts) are predominantly Automate lever plays. They apply across all motions but deliver highest ROI in Medium Touch (volume high enough, ACV high enough to justify the integration investment).

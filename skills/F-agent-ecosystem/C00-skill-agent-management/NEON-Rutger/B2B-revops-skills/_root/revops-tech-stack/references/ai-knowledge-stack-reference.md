## What the knowledge layer does

Gives AI agents and reps access to institutional knowledge (call transcripts, playbooks, CRM data, documented processes) rather than generic LLM output. Four components: ingestion → chunking + indexing → retrieval → delivery.

## Critical insight

**Chunking quality > embedding model choice.** Semantic chunking outperforms naive chunking significantly (practice-based). Design chunking first, pick tools second.

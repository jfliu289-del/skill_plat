# Expansion Scoring Model & Whitespace Analysis

On-demand reference for the cs-operations skill.

Expansion signals and the CS-to-Sales ownership model live in the skill body. This reference holds the scoring model and whitespace analysis detail used to quantify and prioritise expansion plays.

## Expansion Scoring Model

```
EXPANSION SCORING MODEL:
  Score 0-100 based on (practice-based weights):
    Usage growth (30%): is usage increasing month-over-month?
    Stakeholder breadth (25%): are new people engaging?
    Feature depth (20%): are they using advanced features?
    Health trajectory (15%): is health score trending up?
    Contract headroom (10%): is there room to expand (seats, usage, products)?

  NOTE: Weights vary by business model (consumption-based expansion prioritises usage;
  seat-based prioritises stakeholder breadth). Adjust weights quarterly based on your
  expansion conversion rates.

EXPANSION OWNERSHIP (by score):
  Score 0-40:   CSM monitors. No active sell.
  Score 41-70:  CSM plants seeds. Shares relevant content. Mentions capabilities.
  Score 71-100: CSM initiates expansion conversation. If deal > threshold → hand to AE.

  Handoff threshold: Varies by org. Recommended: expansion >30% of current ACV → Sales
  involved (practice-based). Adjust threshold based on your CSM capacity and
  expansion deal-size distribution.
  Below threshold: CSM closes expansion directly (with approval).
```

## Account Scoring for Expansion Readiness

Qualitative readiness triggers that complement the quantitative score:

- Consistent Green health score for 2+ quarters
- Usage of 80%+ of contracted capacity (quantitative trigger)
- Champion has expressed interest in additional use cases
- Stakeholder whitespace: contacts in departments not yet using the product

## Whitespace Analysis

```
WHITESPACE ANALYSIS:
  For each account, map:
    Products purchased vs available    → product whitespace
    Users/seats vs potential           → seat whitespace
    Departments using vs total         → department whitespace
    Features adopted vs available      → feature whitespace
    Stakeholders engaged vs org chart  → relationship whitespace

  Review in QBR. Update quarterly. Use to prioritise expansion plays.
```

**Two dimensions to focus on:**

1. **Stakeholder whitespace:** Which teams or business units could benefit from the product but aren't using it? Map against org chart.
2. **Product whitespace:** Which features or modules is the customer licensed for but not using? Which complementary products are they not yet on?

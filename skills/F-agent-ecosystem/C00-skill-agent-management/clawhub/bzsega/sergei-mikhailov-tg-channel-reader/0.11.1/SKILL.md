# tg-channel-reader

Read posts and comments from Telegram channels using MTProto (Pyrogram or Telethon).
Works with any public channel and private channels the user is subscribed to.
Supports fetching discussion replies (comments) for individual posts.

> **Security notice:** This skill requires `TG_API_ID` and `TG_API_HASH` from [my.telegram.org](https://my.telegram.org). The session file grants full Telegram account access — store it securely and never share it.

---

## Exec Approvals

> **Just installed via `clawhub install`?** Complete Setup & Installation (below) first — the skill needs `pip install`, credentials, and a session file before exec approvals matter.

OpenClaw blocks unknown CLI commands by default. The user must approve `tg-reader` commands before they can run. If the command hangs or the user says nothing is happening — exec approval is likely pending.

### Quick setup (recommended)

Run from the skill directory — checks prerequisites, installs pip packages if needed, and prints the approval commands to run:

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/sergei-mikhailov-tg-channel-reader
bash setup-tg-reader.sh
```

### Manual CLI approval

```bash
openclaw approvals allowlist add --gateway "$(which tg-reader)"
openclaw approvals allowlist add --gateway "$(which tg-reader-check)"
openclaw approvals allowlist add --gateway "$(which tg-reader-telethon)"
```

### Alternative: approve on first use

1. **Control UI** — open `http://localhost:18789/`, find the pending approval for `tg-reader`, click **"Always allow"**. [Docs](https://docs.openclaw.ai/web/control-ui)
2. **Messenger** (Telegram, Slack, Discord) — the bot sends an approval request with an `<id>`. Reply: `/approve <id> allow-always`. Other options: `allow-once`, `deny`.

The approval prompt appears in the **Control UI or as a bot message** — not in the agent's conversation. This is a common source of confusion.

---

## When to Use

- User asks to "check", "read", or "monitor" a Telegram channel
- Wants a digest or summary of recent posts
- Asks "what's new in @channel" or "summarize last 24h from @channel"
- Wants to track or compare multiple channels
- Wants channel info (title, description, subscribers) — use `tg-reader info`

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Run pre-flight diagnostic (fast, no Telegram connection)
tg-reader-check

# 2. Get channel info
tg-reader info @channel_name

# 3. Fetch recent posts
tg-reader fetch @channel_name --since 24h
```

> **`tg-reader: command not found`?** Run `bash setup-tg-reader.sh` from the skill directory (it will install the package), or manually: `cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/sergei-mikhailov-tg-channel-reader && pip install .`

---

## Commands

### `tg-reader-check` — Pre-flight Diagnostic

**Always run before fetching.** Fast offline check — no Telegram connection needed.

```bash
tg-reader-check
tg-reader-check --config-file /path/to/config.json
tg-reader-check --session-file /path/to/session

# Also verify the session is actually AUTHORIZED (connects to Telegram, never prompts)
tg-reader-check --online
```

Returns JSON with `"status": "ok"` or `"status": "error"` plus a `problems` array.

Verifies:
- Credentials available (env vars or `~/.tg-reader.json`)
- Session file exists on disk (with size, modification date)
- At least one MTProto backend installed (Pyrogram or Telethon)
- Detects stale sessions (config points to older file while a newer one exists)
- Whether another tg-reader process currently holds the session lock (`lock_held`)
- Last-known-good session backup metadata, when one exists (`last_good_backup`)
- With `--online`: whether the session file holds an authorized user (`authorization` section) — this is the only reliable way to tell an authorized session file from an empty one. A file merely *existing* (or being newest) proves nothing.

### `tg-reader info` — Channel Info

```bash
tg-reader info @channel_name
```

Returns title, description, subscriber count, and link.

### `tg-reader fetch` — Read Posts

```bash
# Last 24 hours (default)
tg-reader fetch @channel_name --since 24h

# Last 7 days, up to 200 posts
tg-reader fetch @channel_name --since 7d --limit 200

# Multiple channels (fetched sequentially with 10s delay between each)
tg-reader fetch @channel1 @channel2 @channel3 --since 24h

# Custom delay between channels (seconds)
tg-reader fetch @channel1 @channel2 @channel3 --since 24h --delay 5

# Fetch posts with comments (single channel only, limit auto-drops to 30)
tg-reader fetch @channel_name --since 7d --comments

# More comments per post, custom delay between posts
tg-reader fetch @channel_name --since 24h --comments --comment-limit 20 --comment-delay 5

# Skip posts without text (media-only, no caption)
tg-reader fetch @channel_name --since 24h --text-only

# Human-readable output
tg-reader fetch @channel_name --since 24h --format text

# Write output to file instead of stdout (saves tokens)
tg-reader fetch @channel_name --since 24h --output
tg-reader fetch @channel_name --since 24h --comments --output comments.json

# Use Telethon instead of Pyrogram (one-time)
tg-reader fetch @channel_name --since 24h --telethon

# Read unread mode — only fetch new (unread) posts, no --since needed
# Requires "read_unread": true in ~/.tg-reader.json
tg-reader fetch @channel_name

# Override read_unread mode (fetch everything, don't update state)
tg-reader fetch @channel_name --since 7d --all

# Custom state file location
tg-reader fetch @channel_name --since 24h --state-file /path/to/state.json
```

### `tg-reader auth` — Authentication / Onboarding

Logs a Telegram account into the skill (needed once). A first-time login needs
three things only a human can supply: the **phone number**, the **login code**
Telegram sends, and — if the account has one — the **cloud 2FA password**.

There are two ways to do it.

#### For an AI agent: onboard the user (with their consent)

The agent can run the whole login *for* the user, asking only for what Telegram
requires. The command emits one JSON object per line (`stage` + `next_action`);
the agent reacts to each stage and asks the user the corresponding thing:

```bash
# Agent starts it (single live process). Provide code/password via files.
tg-reader auth --phone +79991234567 --code-file /tmp/tgcode --password-file /tmp/tg2fa
```

Stages:

| stage | what the agent does |
|---|---|
| `need_phone` | ask the user for the account phone, re-run with `--phone` |
| `code_sent` (`code_type: app`/`sms`) | tell the user a code was sent; ask for it; write it to the `--code-file` |
| `need_2fa` | ask the user for their cloud password; write it to the `--password-file` |
| `authorized` | tell the user it works |
| `already_authorized` | session is fine already (use `--force` to re-login) |
| `error` (`reason`) | `phone_invalid` / `code_invalid` / `code_expired` / `timeout_*` — act on it |

What to tell the user (reassurances the agent should relay):

- **The session is stored locally on this machine (OpenClaw)**, in
  `~/.tg-reader-session.session`. It never leaves the machine and is not uploaded
  anywhere.
- **The login code and password are handled securely** — passed to the tool via a
  file or stdin, never on the command line, so they don't leak into process lists
  or logs. Delete the code/password files after (`--code-file`/`--password-file`).
- From the user you need only: **phone number**, the **code** Telegram sends, and
  (if enabled) the **2FA password**.

Notes: never passes secrets on argv; reads the code/password from `--code-file` /
`--password-file` (polled) or stdin. An existing session is backed up first
(`.bak-*`, last 3 kept); a dead/unauthorized one is moved aside (`.dead-*`, never
deleted) so the fresh login starts clean. Runs under the session lock. `TG_AUTH_PROGRESS=/path`
also mirrors stages to a file if stdout is buffered through wrapper layers.

#### For the user: do it yourself

If the user would rather not have the agent drive it, print step-by-step
instructions they can follow in their own terminal:

```bash
tg-reader auth --guide
```

Then the user runs `tg-reader auth --phone +7…` themselves and enters the code
(and 2FA password) when asked.

**Never run `auth` from a scheduled/background task** — it needs live input.

### `tg-reader restore-session` — Recover a Broken Session

```bash
tg-reader restore-session
```

After every successful authorized run the skill snapshots the session file to
`{session}.session.last-good` (with a manifest recording when it was verified and
for which user). If the live session file gets emptied, corrupted, or overwritten,
this command puts the last-good copy back: the broken file is moved aside to a
timestamped `.bak-*` (never deleted), the backup is checksum-verified before
install, and the restored session is verified against Telegram (`get_me()`).

Run it only interactively, with the user's confirmation — never from a
scheduled/background task (see Session Safety Rules below).

---

## Read Unread Mode

Only return new (unread) posts — the skill remembers what you've already seen. Useful for daily digests and monitoring workflows.

### Setup

**Option A — config file** (`~/.tg-reader.json`):

```json
{
  "api_id": 12345,
  "api_hash": "...",
  "read_unread": true
}
```

**Option B — env var** (works with `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`):

```bash
export TG_READ_UNREAD=true
```

Env vars take priority over the config file. This lets you enable read_unread via `openclaw.json` Docker `env` alongside `TG_API_ID`/`TG_API_HASH`.

State is stored in `~/.tg-reader-state.json` (configurable via `"state_file"` in config, `TG_STATE_FILE` env var, or `--state-file` flag).

### SOCKS5 proxy (for hosts that block direct MTProto)

Some networks/hosts filter direct MTProto (TCP 443 to Telegram DCs), which shows
up as `Connection timed out` even when the internet works. Route the client
through a local SOCKS5 proxy:

```json
{
  "api_id": 12345,
  "api_hash": "...",
  "socks_proxy": "127.0.0.1:1080"
}
```

Accepted forms: `host:port` (SOCKS5 by default), `socks5://host:port`, or
`socks5://user:pass@host:port`. Env var `TG_PROXY` overrides the config value
(handy for setting the proxy via `openclaw.json` without editing the file).
When unset, the client connects directly (unchanged behavior). Applies to both
backends (Pyrogram/Telethon) and to `tg-reader-check`, which reports the
resolved proxy in `credentials.proxy`.

### Behavior

- **`--since` is not needed** when `read_unread` is enabled — the skill automatically returns all unread posts regardless of time
- **First run** (no prior state for channel): `--since` applies as usual (default 24h); state file created
- **Subsequent runs:** only posts newer than the last read are returned; `--since` is ignored
- **`--all` flag:** bypasses read_unread mode — fetches everything by `--since` without updating state (preserves your position)
- **New channel:** behaves like a first run (no prior state)
- **No new posts:** state unchanged, `count: 0` returned

### Examples

```bash
# With read_unread enabled — just fetch, no --since needed
tg-reader fetch @channel_name

# First run for a new channel — --since determines initial window
tg-reader fetch @new_channel --since 7d

# Override: fetch everything, don't update tracking state
tg-reader fetch @channel_name --since 7d --all
```

### Output

When read_unread mode is active, the JSON output includes a `read_unread` field:

```json
{
  "channel": "@channel_name",
  "read_unread": {"enabled": true},
  "count": 5,
  "messages": [...]
}
```

With `--all`: `"read_unread": {"enabled": true, "overridden": true}`

### Limitations

- Tracking is **post-level only** — new comments on already-read posts are not caught
- If a channel changes its username, tracking resets (state is keyed by username)
- Concurrent runs for the same channel are safe but last writer wins

### Diagnostic

`tg-reader-check` reports tracking status:

```json
{
  "tracking": {
    "read_unread": true,
    "state_file": "~/.tg-reader-state.json",
    "state_file_exists": true,
    "tracked_channels": 3
  }
}
```

---

## Output Format

### `info`

```json
{
  "id": -1001234567890,
  "title": "Channel Name",
  "username": "channel_name",
  "description": "About this channel...",
  "members_count": 42000,
  "link": "https://t.me/channel_name"
}
```

### `fetch`

```json
{
  "channel": "@channel_name",
  "fetched_at": "2026-02-22T10:00:00Z",
  "since": "2026-02-21T10:00:00Z",
  "count": 12,
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": 1234,
      "date": "2026-02-22T09:30:00Z",
      "text": "Post content...",
      "views": 5200,
      "forwards": 34,
      "link": "https://t.me/channel_name/1234",
      "has_media": true,
      "media_type": "MessageMediaType.PHOTO"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Optional `web_page` field** — present only when a post carries a Telegram link-preview card (e.g. Instant View articles, link shares). Photos / videos / documents are reported via `has_media` + `media_type`, not here.

```json
{
  "id": 9876,
  "text": "Card title\n\nCard description...\n\nhttps://example.com/article",
  "has_media": false,
  "web_page": {
    "url": "https://example.com/article",
    "display_url": "example.com/article",
    "title": "Card title",
    "description": "Card description...",
    "site_name": "Example Site"
  }
}
```

When the message has no text of its own (a common pattern for channels publishing via Instant View), the `text` field is **synthesized** from `title + description + url` so the post still surfaces. The `web_page` object carries the original structured data for agents that want them separately.

### `fetch` with `--comments`

```json
{
  "channel": "@channel_name",
  "fetched_at": "2026-02-28T10:00:00Z",
  "since": "2026-02-27T10:00:00Z",
  "count": 5,
  "comments_enabled": true,
  "comments_available": true,
  "messages": [
    {
      "id": 1234,
      "text": "Post content...",
      "has_media": false,
      "comment_count": 2,
      "comments": [
        {
          "id": 5678,
          "date": "2026-02-28T09:35:00Z",
          "text": "Great post!",
          "from_user": "username123"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Notes:**
- `comments_available: false` — channel has no linked discussion group (no comments possible)
- `comments_error` on a message — rate limit hit for that post's comments
- `from_user` may be `null` for anonymous comments
- Images/videos in comments are **not analyzed** — only text is captured
- Default post limit drops to 30 when `--comments` is active (override with `--limit`)

---

## After Fetching

1. Parse the JSON output
2. Posts with images/videos have `has_media: true` and a `media_type` field. Their text is in the `text` field (from the caption). **Do not skip posts just because they have media** — they often contain important text.
3. Images and videos are **not analyzed** (no OCR/vision) — only the text/caption is returned.
4. Posts with a Telegram link-preview card carry a `web_page` object (URL, title, description, site name). For Instant-View articles the `text` field is synthesized from the card, so these posts surface in summaries just like text posts — **do not skip them** even when `has_media: false`.
5. Summarize key themes, top posts by views, notable links
6. If `comments_enabled: true`, analyze comment sentiment and key themes alongside the main posts
7. Save summary to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` if user wants to track over time

### Saving to File (Token Economy)

Use `--output` when the result is large (especially with `--comments`) and you don't need to analyze it immediately. The full data goes to a file, and stdout returns only a short confirmation — **this saves tokens**.

**Periodic updates pattern:** set up a cron task that runs `tg-reader fetch @channel --comments --output comments.json` on schedule. The file gets updated regularly. When the user asks to analyze comments — read the file instead of re-fetching. This avoids consuming tokens on every fetch.

When `--output` is used without a filename, the default is `tg-output.json`. Stdout confirmation:
```json
{"status": "ok", "output_file": "/absolute/path/to/tg-output.json", "count": 12}
```

### Saving Channel List

Store tracked channels in `TOOLS.md`:

```markdown
## Telegram Channels
- @channel1 — why tracked
- @channel2 — why tracked
```

---

## Error Handling

Errors include an `error_type` and `action` field to help agents decide what to do automatically.

### Channel Errors

| `error_type` | Meaning | `action` |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| `access_denied` | Channel is private, you were kicked, or access is restricted | `remove_from_list_or_rejoin` — ask user if they still have access; if not, remove the channel |
| `banned` | You are banned from this channel | `remove_from_list` — remove the channel, tell the user |
| `not_found` | Channel doesn't exist or username is wrong | `check_username` — verify the @username with the user |
| `invite_expired` | Invite link is expired or invalid | `request_new_invite` — ask user for a new invite link |
| `flood_wait` | Telegram rate limit | `wait_Ns` — waits ≤ 60 s are retried automatically; longer waits return this error |
| `comments_multi_channel` | `--comments` used with multiple channels | `remove_extra_channels_or_drop_comments` — use one channel at a time |

### Session Errors

| `error_type` | Meaning | `action` |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| `not_authorized` | Session file holds no authorized user — empty, corrupted, overwritten, or (only when the message names a specific Telegram error like `AuthKeyUnregistered`/`SessionRevoked`) actually rejected by Telegram | `offer_restore` when a last-good backup exists (propose `tg-reader restore-session` to the user), otherwise `run_auth_interactive` (interactive `tg-reader auth` — needs the user) |
| `busy` | Another tg-reader process holds the session lock | `retry_later` |
| `network` | Could not reach Telegram — says **nothing** about session validity | `retry_later` — do NOT treat as an auth problem |

**Never invent causes.** Do not tell the user the session "expired" or "was
revoked by Telegram" unless the error message names a concrete Telegram error
(`AuthKeyUnregistered`, `SessionRevoked`, ...). A `not_authorized` on a local
file usually means the *file* is bad, while the session on Telegram's side is
still alive — recoverable via `restore-session` without a new login.

### Session Safety Rules (agents, read carefully)

1. **Never delete, move, rename, or overwrite session files.** Recovery goes
   through `tg-reader restore-session` (which preserves the broken file) or
   interactive `tg-reader auth` — nothing else.
2. **From a scheduled/background run:** on `not_authorized` or `busy`, notify
   the user and exit. No auth attempts, no restore, no config edits, no file
   surgery. Auth needs a login code only the user can receive.
3. **Never switch `--session-file` to another found file blindly** — verify it
   first: `tg-reader-check --online --session-file <path>`. An existing or
   newer file may be an empty, never-authorized session.
4. **One session path everywhere.** All cron/background commands must use the
   same `--session-file` (or the same default). Concurrent access is guarded
   by a lock (`busy` error), but path drift creates orphan sessions.

### System Errors

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| `Session file not found` | Run `tg-reader-check` — if other session files were found, verify with `tg-reader-check --online --session-file <path>` before switching |
| `Missing credentials` | Guide user through Setup (Step 1-2 below) |
| `tg-reader: command not found` | Run `bash setup-tg-reader.sh` from the skill directory, or manually: `pip install .` Fallback: `python3 -m tg_reader_unified` |

### Auth Code Not Arriving

Use the verbose debug script for full MTProto-level logs:

```bash
python3 debug_auth.py
```

> **Warning:** `debug_auth.py` deletes existing session files before re-authenticating. It will ask for confirmation first.

---

## Library Selection

Two MTProto backends are supported:

| Backend | Command | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Pyrofork** (default) | `tg-reader` or `tg-reader-pyrogram` | Drop-in fork of Pyrogram with current Telegram TL schema. Installs as the `pyrogram` package. The CLI command keeps the `pyrogram` name for backwards compatibility. |
| **Telethon** | `tg-reader-telethon` | Alternative backend with separate implementation |

> **Why pyrofork instead of pyrogram:** the upstream `pyrogram` package on PyPI (2.0.106, Aug 2023) does not parse Telegram `Message` TL constructor IDs introduced in May 2026, so recent posts come through with empty `message`/`media`/`entities`. `pyrofork` is a community fork that ships the current schema. Sessions are format-compatible — switching does **not** require re-authentication.

Switch persistently: `export TG_USE_TELETHON=true`
Switch one-time: `tg-reader fetch @channel --since 24h --telethon`

---

## Setup & Installation

Full details in [README.md](./README.md).

### Step 1 — Get API Credentials

Go to https://my.telegram.org → **API Development Tools** → create an app → copy `api_id` and `api_hash`.

### Step 2 — Save Credentials

**Recommended** (works in agents and servers):
```bash
cat > ~/.tg-reader.json << 'EOF'
{
  "api_id": YOUR_ID,
  "api_hash": "YOUR_HASH"
}
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.tg-reader.json
```

**Alternative** (interactive shell only):
```bash
export TG_API_ID=YOUR_ID
export TG_API_HASH="YOUR_HASH"
```
Set these in your current shell session. Avoid writing `TG_API_HASH` to shell profiles (`~/.bashrc`) — use `~/.tg-reader.json` instead for persistent storage.

> **Note:** Agents and servers don't load shell profiles. Use `~/.tg-reader.json` (the recommended method above) for non-interactive environments.

### Step 3 — Install & Configure

```bash
npx clawhub@latest install sergei-mikhailov-tg-channel-reader
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/sergei-mikhailov-tg-channel-reader
bash setup-tg-reader.sh
```

The setup script: installs Python packages (`pip install .`), checks credentials and session, runs `tg-reader-check`, and prints the exec approval commands for you to run manually.

On Linux with managed Python (Ubuntu/Debian), use a venv **before** running the setup script:

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/.venv/tg-reader
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.venv/tg-reader/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```

<details>
<summary>Manual install (without setup script)</summary>

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/sergei-mikhailov-tg-channel-reader
# pyrofork replaces pyrogram; uninstall pyrogram first if it was already installed
pip uninstall pyrogram -y 2>/dev/null
pip install pyrofork tgcrypto telethon && pip install .
openclaw approvals allowlist add --gateway "$(which tg-reader)"
openclaw approvals allowlist add --gateway "$(which tg-reader-check)"
```
</details>

### Step 4 — Authenticate

```bash
tg-reader auth
```

Pyrogram will ask to confirm the phone number — answer `y`. The code arrives in the Telegram app (not SMS).

### Step 5 — Verify

```bash
tg-reader-check
```

Should return `"status": "ok"`. If not — fix the reported issues and re-run `bash setup-tg-reader.sh`.

---

## Scheduled Tasks & Cron

This skill needs network access (MTProto connection to Telegram servers) and a session file. How you configure OpenClaw cron depends on the session target.

> **Important:** When setting up a scheduled task that uses `tg-reader`, tell the user which approach you're using and what it means — so they can make an informed choice.

### Option A — `sessionTarget: "main"` (recommended)

The cron task sends a **reminder** to the main agent session. The agent then runs `tg-reader` in the main environment where the skill, credentials, and session file are already available.

**Pros:** No extra configuration — everything works out of the box.
**Cons:** Not fully autonomous — the task sends a system event, the agent picks it up and executes. Requires `payload.kind: "systemEvent"` (OpenClaw cron API limitation for main target).

**How to set up:**
1. Create a cron task with `sessionTarget: "main"` and `payload.kind: "systemEvent"`
2. In the task description, include the exact `tg-reader` command to run
3. The agent receives the reminder and executes the command in its main session

### Option B — `sessionTarget: "isolated"` (autonomous, complex setup)

The cron task runs in a **Docker container** — fully autonomous, no agent interaction needed. However, the container starts empty: no skill, no credentials, no session file.

**Pros:** Fully autonomous — runs on schedule without agent involvement.
**Cons:** Requires Docker setup; session file must be mounted into the container (may not work reliably — session files are tied to the machine and Telegram may invalidate them in a new environment).

**Required configuration in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:**

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "sandbox": {
        "docker": {
          "setupCommand": "clawhub install sergei-mikhailov-tg-channel-reader && cd ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/sergei-mikhailov-tg-channel-reader && pip uninstall pyrogram -y 2>/dev/null; pip install pyrofork tgcrypto telethon && pip install .",
          "env": {
            "TG_API_ID": "YOUR_ID",
            "TG_API_HASH": "YOUR_HASH",
            "TG_READ_UNREAD": "true"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Session file caveat:** The Telegram session file (`~/.tg-reader-session.session`) must also be available inside the container. This may require Docker volume mounting and might not work reliably — Telegram can invalidate sessions when they appear from a different environment. If you encounter `AUTH_KEY_UNREGISTERED` errors in isolated mode, switch to Option A.

### Explicit paths (both options)

When `~/` is not available or points to a different location, use explicit paths:

```bash
tg-reader-check \
  --config-file /home/user/.tg-reader.json \
  --session-file /home/user/.tg-reader-session

tg-reader fetch @channel --since 6h \
  --config-file /home/user/.tg-reader.json \
  --session-file /home/user/.tg-reader-session
```

Both flags work with all subcommands and both backends.

## Security

- Session file (`~/.tg-reader-session.session`) grants **full account access** — keep it safe
- The skill maintains sibling files next to the session: `.session.lock` (concurrency guard), `.session.last-good` + `.session.last-good.json` (verified backup + no-secrets manifest), `.session.bak-*` (timestamped backups, last 3 kept). The backup copies grant the same full account access as the session itself — all are created with `0600` permissions and must never be shared or committed
- Never share or commit `TG_API_HASH` or session files
- `TG_API_HASH` is a secret — store in env vars or config file, never in git
